# my_robot
ROS Project to practice Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) package in a custom world

### Built on:
ROS Kinetic & Ubuntu 16.04

### Intro: 
My first try at executing AMC Localization using the AMCL and the move_base package. The world is a single floor area and it's 2D map was generated using the pgm_map_creator package. This map was then provided as the ground truth map for localization.
